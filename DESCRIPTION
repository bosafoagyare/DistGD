Description: Distributed Gradient Descent efficiently optimizes a global objective function  expressed
    as a sum of a list of local objective functions belonging to different agents situated in a network.
    You supply a list of local objective functions, weights of the connections between the agents,
    initialize a vector initial values, and it takes care of the details, returning the optimal values.
